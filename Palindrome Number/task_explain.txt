palindrome or Not ?

Example 1: 
    Input: x = 121

    Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:
    Input: x = -121
    Output: false
    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:
    Input: x = 10
    Output: false
    Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

*****************SOLUTION ALGORITHM**********
input ==> int x
output ==> bool result
